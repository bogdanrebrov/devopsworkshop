## GoWeb-PostgreSQL

This is application writed on Golang + HTML + JS

You can use it with Terraform code for Workshops, Meetups, etc.

We have made several changes to use env.

Here is a list of variables what needs to be used in the env file:

export DBPORT= "Your DB Port"

export DBHOST= "Your DB Host"

export DBUSER= "Your DB user"

export DBPASS= "Your DB Password"

echo export DBNAME = "Your DB Name"


Based on project [GoWeb-PostgreSQL](https://adaickalavan.github.io/portfolio/golang-web-application-with-postgresql/)
